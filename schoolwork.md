## 3D Bacteria Art for Molecular Biology
For my final project in *Honors Chemistry 2: Research in Molecular Biology* (prompt was open-ended: research/do something), I wanted to recreate the Deerfield logo using fluorescent bacteria in multiple colors. I used 3D printed molds to set agarose gel in the shape of the Deerfield logo. The first main challenge was 3D printing material that would not warp under the high temperature/pressure of a sterilized autoclave. The second main challenge was extracting agarose gel from the molds without breaking the shape. The third challenge I encountered was that the bacteria did not glow for some of the color strains, but I was unable to find a solution to this (my final product was monochrome).

## 3D Printed Map for English – A Place We Call Home
The project was to build a creative visual representation of a place we call home. I built a 3D-printed map of stacked-up layers – each layer representing a different aspect of home.

- A large centerpiece map showing landmasses and water
- My old school – aerial view
- My old house – model
- My housing colony – model/map
- The Kochi airport
- The Kochi Metro public transit map
- My cousin’s house

I mostly used 2D maps and sketches which I then extended to 3D space. I used some models from Thingiverse for standard objects like houses and the airport control tower. The prints are imperfect because it was my first time using the printers at Deerfield, and they are multicolored because I ran out of filament in some colors.
