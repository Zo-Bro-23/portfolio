High school student trying to get somewhere...

I'm into:
- Coding
- Music
- Tinkering
- Minecraft
- Euro Truck Simulator 2 and Microsoft Flight Simulator
- YouTube (hardcore)
- People

I'm currently homeschooled, and I take online courses from institutions like Johns Hopkins CTY, Art of Problem Solving, and PA Homeschoolers. Taking 6 AP courses now - it's hard, but it's also fun :)
