High school student trying to get somewhere...

I'm into:
- Coding
- Acting
- Engineering
- Writing
- Minecraft
- Euro Truck Simulator 2
- People

After being homeschooled for three years, I moved to the US to attend boarding school. I currently go to Deerfield Academy, and I'm dabbling in all my interests, trying to figure out where life will take me :)
